1. Clone/Download from warehouse branch
2. Set up the environment
	(1) Install vcpkg
	(2) Download websocketpp(.\vcpkg install websocketpp:x64-windows), freeopcua(.\vcpkg install freeopcua:x64-windows), protobuf(.\vcpkg install protobuf:x64-windows), 
boost(.\vcpkg install boost:x64-windows) from vcpkg 
This video shows how to install vcpkg and download packages from it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnjahwxZ8A&t=137s
3. Set up the protobuf files
Make sure the proto files are compiled by the same or older version of protobuf compiler. 

Notes: 
(1) In main.cpp: The AccessToken gets updated once a week from Axini
(2) In Websocket.h: OPCUA server/client can be generated here using ServerGenerator/ClientGenerator.
Parameter for ServerGenerator is the url of the server. In UAEXPERT, the same url address needs to be used to connect with the server.
(3) In Websocket.cpp: It is very IMPORTANT to firstly annouce all the lables (stimuli/response) defined in your model.
(4) After connecting the adapter to Axini, you need to go to Adapters-> Edit mapping-> Save(if all your labels are announced already)
